When EnabledState is set to 5 (\"Not Applicable\"), this property is not applicable. For explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration, see the EnabledState property description. \"Unknown\" (0) indicates that the last requested state for the element is unknown. The value \"No Change\" (5) is deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is \"Unknown\" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState has the value \"Unknown\" (0) but may have the value \"No Change\" (5). Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState. There are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These values are \"Reboot\" (10) and \"Reset\" (11). Reboot refers to performing a \"Shut Down\" and then moving to an \"Enabled\" state. Reset indicates that the element is first \"Disabled\" and then \"Enabled\". The \"Shut Down\" and \"Disabled\" requests are different. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state and might involve removing power to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it does not execute or accept any commands or processing requests.

                    "longDescription": "RequestedState is an integer enumeration that indicates the last requested or desired state for the element, irrespective of the mechanism through which it was requested. The actual state of the element is represented by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and the current state of enabled or disabled. When EnabledState is set to 5 (\"Not Applicable\"), this property is not applicable. For explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration, see the EnabledState property description. \"Unknown\" (0) indicates that the last requested state for the element is unknown. The value \"No Change\" (5) is deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is \"Unknown\" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState has the value \"Unknown\" (0) but may have the value \"No Change\" (5). Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState. There are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These values are \"Reboot\" (10) and \"Reset\" (11). Reboot refers to performing a \"Shut Down\" and then moving to an \"Enabled\" state. Reset indicates that the element is first \"Disabled\" and then \"Enabled\". The \"Shut Down\" and \"Disabled\" requests are different. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state and might involve removing power to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it does not execute or accept any commands or processing requests.
